# Weather-Dashboard

GOAL: 

The overall goal of this project was to create a weather dashboard from scratch. 

In order to achieve this goal, I was supposed to incorporate an assigned server-side API, the OpenWeather API. I was also assigned to make use of the browser's local storage feature.

The weather dashboard was supposed to give the weather outlook for multiple chosen cities, and contain these specific features:

- A form input where, when the user searches for a specific city, they are shown the city's current and future weather;
- Once the input is searched, it is put into a search history;
-
